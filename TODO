Change how we handle fields
	* Instead of making these abstract attempts at field names and field
		values, just make a set number of fields - durationMin, durationSec,
		date, miles, pounds, comments, weather, etc. etc.
	* Same thing for equipment
	* Have a GUI options panel that controls whether or not they're shown.
		Save the contents of the options panel along with wherever you're saving
		the workouts, and load it whenever the GUI loads
	* Do what Indeed does with DailyIndexFields - have a class called
		"WorkoutFields" that just contains constants for all of the fields we
		could possibly store. If anything, overstore rather than understore,
		because it's really easy to just hide stuff or thrown in placeholders /
		nulls / empty strings!
Change how we handle workouts
	* Maintain a save file / database entry (same place as the GUI options) that
		declares workout names matched with which fields the user wants to show
		for them -- this way, you can create arbitrary workouts and it'll just
		"work". 
	* Same thing with equipment / what fields get shown for equipment
